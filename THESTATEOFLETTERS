So right now, Letters is no longer pulling data from an imap server.

Instead, you'll need to run imapPull.py in the bin directory like so:

imapPull.py username password imapserver

It connects to port 993 by default via SSL, and downloads the messages to Letters's message cache.  The next time Crashy launches, it'll see the cached messages.  It'll still crash though.  I PROMISE!

Your prefs in Crashy need to point to the same server as well, so it knows where to look in the message cache.

If someone wants to stup up and take care of IMAP stuff, let me know.  I added some pyobjc code that crashy was bridging to, but GCD and blocks are out with this, which blows.  It's checked in, but it's not compiled in currently (LBPYIMAPConnection, IMAPFetcher.py)
