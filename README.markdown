What you'll find here isn't actually Letters.  It's a prototype named "CrashyEmailApp" which, as you might have guessed, is going to crash when you build and run it.

**What this build is for**

It's for a bit of experimentation, and to act as a starting point.  It currently allows you to send plain text email, check your imap inbox, and crashes.

**TODO:**

  - Pretty much everything
  - Keychain support
  - Support for multiple accounts
  - Responding to messages
  - Threading
  - A sane cache store (the current implmentation loads everything into memory right now, and is slow)
  - Management of the server connections
  - Activity Monitor (you wanted to cancel something?)
  - Plugin API
  - A UI that doesn't make designers faint
  - Stop crashing
  - Etc.
